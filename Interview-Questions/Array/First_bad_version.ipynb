    "Detailed Walkthrough\n",
    "Initialization:\n",
    "\n",
    "left is initialized to 1 (the first version).\n",
    "right is initialized to n (the last version).\n",
    "Binary Search Loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "The loop continues as long as left < right. This ensures that the search space is reduced until left equals right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside the loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "mid is calculated as the midpoint between left and right using the formula mid = left + (right - left) // 2. This avoids potential overflow that could occur with large values of left and right in some programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "If isBadVersion(mid) returns False, it means that the first bad version must be to the right of mid. Hence, we update left to mid + 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "If isBadVersion(mid) returns True, it means that the first bad version is either at mid or to the left of it, so we update right to mid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Termination:\n",
    "\n",
    "The loop exits when left == right, which means we have narrowed down the search to a single version. This version is the first bad version.\n",
    "Return:\n",
    "\n",
    "The method returns left, which is the index of the first bad version.\n",
    "Example Execution\n",
    "Assume n = 5, and the bad versions start from 3. The code execution would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "Initial state: left = 1, right = 5\n",
    "\n",
    "First Iteration:\n",
    "mid = (1 + (5 - 1) // 2) = 3\n",
    "isBadVersion(3) is True (because 3 is a bad version).\n",
    "So, right = 3.\n",
    "Second Iteration:\n",
    "mid = (1 + (3 - 1) // 2) = 2\n",
    "isBadVersion(2) is False (because 2 is a good version).\n",
    "So, left = 3.\n",
    "Now, left = 3 and right = 3, so the loop exits.\n",
    "\n",
    "The method returns left, which is 3, the first bad version.\n",
    "\n",
    "Efficiency\n",
    "This algorithm is efficient because it uses binary search, reducing the number of isBadVersion calls from potentially O(n) to O(log n)."
